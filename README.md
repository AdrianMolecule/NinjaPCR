NinjaPCR
============
NinjaPCR is Opensource(GPLv3) DNA Amplifier,Thermocycler Implementation for [Polymerase Chain Reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) developed by [Toriningen Inc.](http://www.tori.st) ([Shingo Hisakawa](https://www.facebook.com/hisakawa) and [Mariko Hisakawa](https://www.facebook.com/maripo)) in Tokyo,Japan.<br />

#Please refer our [wiki](http://pcr.tori.st) to learn how to make.

Forked from [OpenPCR](https://github.com/jperfetto/OpenPCR).

Major changes from OpenPCR:<br />
01. Get smaller by using AC adapter<br />
02. Platform changed from AdobeAIR to [ChromeApp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/makerstoy-pcr/hoeafinlaiemkjnkakfbdpobhpicjbmb/details)<br />
03. Support [Multi OS (Windows,Mac,Linux,ChromeOS)](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95411?hl=en)<br />
04. LCD removed,Software enchanced (ex.Temperature graph)<br />
05. Software auto update for new features (ex.Mail alert scheduled)<br />
06. Reusable Arduino UNO (firmware not overwritten for AdobeAIR)<br />
07. Reusable [Motor Driver Carrier](http://www.pololu.com/product/1451) (Not soldered to PCB)<br />
08. High precision at both low/high temperature (Scheduled)<br />
09. Added RGB LED (Scheduled)<br />
10. You can order primer from app (Scheduled)<br />

Minor differences from OpenPCR:<br />
11. Cleared its Design Rule Check of PCB<br />
12. Simpler metal parts (drilling to bending)<br />
13. Unit is changed from inch to mm<br />
