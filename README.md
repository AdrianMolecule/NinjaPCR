05. Software auto update for new features<br />
06. Reusable Arduino UNO (firmware not overwritten)<br />
07. Reusable [Motor Driver Carrier](http://www.pololu.com/product/1451) (Not soldered to PCB)<br />
08. High precision at high temperature (Scheduled)<br />
09. Added RGB LED (Scheduled)<br />
10. You can order primer from app (Scheduled)<br />
<br />
Minor differences from OpenPCR:<br />
